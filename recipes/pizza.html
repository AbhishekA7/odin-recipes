         </ul>
         <h4>Directions Checklist</h4>
         <ol>
               <li>Take a dough kneading plate and add all-purpose flour to it. Next, add salt and 
                    baking powder in it and sieve the flour once. Then, make a well in the centre and 
                    add 1 teaspoon of oil to it. On the other hand, take a little warm water and mix 
                    the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 
                    minutes. The yeast will rise in the meantime. Once the yeast has risen, add it to
                    the flour knead the dough nicely using some water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 
                    hours. Then knead the dough once again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.</li>
               <li>
                    Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base 
                    when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large 
                    amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice 
                    circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) 
                    Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the 
                    base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake 
                    it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.
               </li>
               <li>Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and 
                    cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and 
                    mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those tomatoes have less 
                    juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and 
                    mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.</li>
               <li>
                    Then, take the fresh pizza base and apply tomato ketchup all over. Spread half 
                    the processed cheese all over the base and evenly put the veggies all across the 
                    base. Once you have put all the veggies, put a thick layer of mozzarella cheese.
               </li>
               <li>
                    Put this pizza base in a baking tray and place it inside the oven. Let the pizza 
                    bake 10 minutes at 250 degree Celsius. Once done, take out the baking tray and 
                    slice the pizza. Sprinkle oregano and chilli flakes as per your taste and serve 
                    hot. (Note: Make sure that the oven is preheated at 250 degree Celsius for 5 
                    minutes at least.)
